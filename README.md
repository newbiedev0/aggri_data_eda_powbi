INSIGHTS FROM EDA

summary of findings from EDA:

1)west bengal is the highest rice producing state among others.

2)uttar pradesh  is highest wheat producing and second highest is punjab in production among others.

3)madhya pradesh is the highest oilseed producer among other states.

4)karnataka is the highest producer in sunflower

5)sugarcane production in india saw the considerable increase over last 50 years. 

6)Both rice and wheat production over the years has seen a tremendous increase in india.

7)In west bengal the midnapur district is the largest rice producer with staggerin difference from other districts.

8) After 2003 the wheat production in uttar pradesh increased consistently

9)finger millet production in india is in the pattern of decreasing steadily over last 50 years

10)pearl millet production over the last 50 years is in the pattern of increasing steadily

11)kharif sorghum production is in the pattern of oscillation with no steady increase or decrease and last 20 years production is steep decrease

12)rabi sorghum production is increasing steady and stable over the years.

13)gujarat is the leading groundnut producer amonga all the other states.

14)madya pradesh is the leading soyabean producer with staggering difference compared to other states

15)yield efficiency for soyabean is highest in telangana

16)rice production is increased with increase in area

17)maize production over years is increased vastly after 2010.

18)rice vs wheaet yield over states shows no relation between rice and wheat production, intead shows the both of them yield increased over the cultivated area and depend on the region.

power BI insights:

Rice Production Trends: The top three rice-producing states show a clear year-over-year production trend, with some exhibiting consistent growth and others showing fluctuations.

Wheat Yield Improvement: The analysis identified the top five districts with the most significant increase in wheat yield over the last five years, pointing to regions with successful agricultural practices.

Oilseed Production Growth: By analyzing a five-year growth rate, the study pinpointed the states with the highest growth in oilseed production, highlighting promising regions for agricultural investment.

Area vs. Production Correlation: The analysis of key crops revealed a strong positive correlation between the area cultivated and total production, confirming that a larger planted area generally leads to higher output.

Cotton Production Trends: The yearly production growth of cotton in the top five states shows both periods of stability and significant change, reflecting the impact of various market and environmental factors.

Groundnut Production Leaders: The data identifies the leading districts in groundnut production for a specific year, providing a snapshot of the crop's key production hubs.

Annual Maize Yield: An average maize yield analysis across all states reveals the overall health and productivity trends of the national maize sector over time.

Total Cultivated Area: The analysis quantified the total area dedicated to oilseed cultivation in each state, providing a clear overview of the scale of this industry.

Highest Rice Yielding Districts: The findings pinpoint the districts with the highest rice yield per hectare, which can be used to study best practices for maximizing crop output.

Wheat vs. Rice Production Comparison: A side-by-side comparison of wheat and rice production in the top five states demonstrates how these two major crops perform relative to each other over a ten-year period.
